Most of the code in here is (c) Copyrighted by Numerical Recipes Software.

These routines were tested by us at IAS in 1986/87 as NR was converted from
Fortran to C, provided by W. Press, by a machine translator.

You cannot use these selected few outside of NEMO because of interface
and code changes. Please be careful in using them; some routines have
a slightly different parameter sequence or type than their
corresponding NumRec version to make them work within the NEMO
environment. Also, some routines do not use the #define's, but instead
of control parameters.
