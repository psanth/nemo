.TH FAKE 8NEMO "3 July 2020"
.SH NAME
fake \- creating fake data
.SH DESCRIPTION
For many problems you may need to start with fake data, and since there
are so many programs in NEMO that can do this, here we list a few common
ones to get you started.  Much of this information is of course present
in the many man pages and manuals, this is just another place to get
you started. See also \fIdata(5NEMO)\fP for some prepared data file.
.SH EXAMPLES
A few types of tables:
.nf

    nemoinp 1:1000 | tabmath - - rang(0,1) > tab1
    mkplummer - 1000 | snapprint - > tab2
    tabgen - > tab3
