.TH CCDRGB 1NEMO "18 July 2020"
.SH NAME
ccdrgb \- create composite RGB color images from multiple input images
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBccdrgb\fP [parameter=value]
.SH DESCRIPTION
No description available. This manual page was created by mkman
.PP
To convert an RGB into a greyscale image, there are some general
practices:
.nf
   Y = .2126 * R^gamma + .7152 * G^gamma + .0722 * B^gamma
.fi
where gamma = 2.2 typically. This is the Y in XYZ color space. Followed by
.nf
   L* = 116 * Y ^ 1/3 - 16
.fi
in LAB  color space, where L* 
"... aspires to perceptual uniformity ... closely matches human perception of lightness."

.SH PARAMETERS
The following parameters are recognized in any order if the keyword
is also given:
.TP 20
\fBin1=\fP
Input \fIRed\fP image [???]     
.TP
\fBin2=\fP
Input \fIGreen\fP image [???]     
.TP
\fBin3=\fP
Input \fIBlue\fP image.  If none supplied, the middle channel
is computing from the other two, using \fBc=\fP.
.TP
\fBout=\fP
Output image file [???]    
.TP
\fBc=\fP
color composition index RGB=(A, B+c*A, B) if only 2 images
are used. [0.5] 
.TP
\fBrange1=\fP
Range in image 1 to map. By default the full ranges are used. 
.TP
\fBrange2=\fP
Range in image 2.
.TP
\fBrange3=\fP
Range in image 3.
