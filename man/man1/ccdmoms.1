.TH CCDMOMS 1NEMO "15 December 2020"
.SH NAME
ccdmoms \- moment along a set of images
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBccdmoms\fP [parameter=value]
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBccdmoms\fP acts somewhat similar to \fIccdmom(1NEMO)\fP with a fourth axis, which runs over the input
files. One can sum, taken the mean, dispersion etc. along this set of images. Weights can also be given
for each image, either as a scalar, or as a map.
.SH PARAMETERS
The following parameters are recognized in any order if the keyword
is also given:
.TP 20
\fBin=\fP
Input image files, in \fIimage(5NEMO)\fP format, separated by comma's. No default.
.TP
\fBout=\fP
Output image file. No default.
.TP 
\fBmom=\fP
Moment to take (0=sum,1=mean,2=disp,-1=median)
Default: -1 (mean value)
.TP 
\fBweights=\fP
Scalar weights, one per image. By default all the same. The RMS per image can
also be given, in which case \fBsigma=t\fP (see below) needs to be set.
.TP
\fBaxis=\fP
WCS axis values of the images in case the mom= requires this. By default they
are assigned 0,1,2,.... (not implemented yet)
.TP 
\fBwin=\fP
Optional input image weights, one per input file (not implemented yet)
.TP
\fBsigma=t|f\fP
Are the weights still SIGMA (t), or straight weights (f)  [f]
.SH EXAMPLES
Taking an average of N images:
